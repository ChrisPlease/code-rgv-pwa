        The Committee shall meet as necessary, at minimum once per calendar
        month, and appropriate at the call of the Chairperson of the Committee
        or the Executive Director, and shall maintain minutes of all meetings,
        which will be distributed to the Board along with other required
        reporting as requested by the Board, in advance of the next regularly
        scheduled Board meeting. Meetings shall be governed by Robertâ€™s Rules of
        Order, insofar as such rules are not inconsistent with or in conflict
        with this charter, or with provisions of law.

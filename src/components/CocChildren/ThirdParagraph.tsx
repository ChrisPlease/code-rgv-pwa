      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
      comply immediately.
    `,
    `
      Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
      particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities,
      or other material.

      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may
      take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the
      offender or expulsion from the event.

      We expect participants to follow these rules at meeting and
